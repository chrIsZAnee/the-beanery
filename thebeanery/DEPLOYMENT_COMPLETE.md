## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Before Deploying:
1. **Push your code to GitHub** - Both Render and Netlify deploy from Git
2. **Create accounts** - Sign up for Render and Netlify (both have free tiers)
3. **Read the deployment guide** - Follow steps in order

### During Deployment:
1. **Deploy backend first** - Get the backend URL
2. **Then deploy frontend** - Use backend URL in environment
3. **Update CORS** - Update backend CORS with frontend URL
4. **Test thoroughly** - Check all functionality works

### After Deployment:
1. **Monitor logs** - Check for errors in dashboards
2. **Test all features** - Try submitting feedback, browsing pages
3. **Note the URLs** - Save your deployed URLs

## 🎯 Deployment Checklist

### Pre-Deployment
- [ ] Code committed to GitHub
- [ ] Render account created
- [ ] Netlify account created
- [ ] Read deployment guide

### Render Setup (Backend + Database)
- [ ] MySQL database created
- [ ] SQL schema imported
- [ ] Web service created (Docker)
- [ ] Environment variables set
- [ ] Backend deployed successfully
- [ ] Health check passing
- [ ] Backend URL noted

### Netlify Setup (Frontend)
- [ ] Repository connected
- [ ] Build settings configured
- [ ] Environment variable set
- [ ] Frontend deployed successfully
- [ ] Site loads correctly
- [ ] Frontend URL noted

### Post-Deployment
- [ ] CORS updated on backend
- [ ] Backend redeployed
- [ ] API calls working
- [ ] Feedback form works
- [ ] All routes work
- [ ] No console errors

---

## 🏆 Success Criteria

Your deployment is successful when:

✅ Backend health check returns: `{"status":"ok","message":"Server is running"}`  
✅ Frontend loads without errors  
✅ All pages are accessible  
✅ Feedback form submits successfully  
✅ No CORS errors in browser console  
✅ Database queries work correctly  

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Test locally first** - Use Docker to test before deploying
2. **Use setup scripts** - Run `setup-env.bat/.sh` to create all env files
3. **Check logs often** - Logs tell you what's wrong
4. **URLs must match exactly** - No trailing slashes in CORS_ORIGIN or VITE_API_URL
5. **Free tier is fine** - Start with free, upgrade if needed
6. **Auto-deploy is enabled** - Push to GitHub = auto-deploy
7. **First request might be slow** - Render free tier spins down after 15 min
